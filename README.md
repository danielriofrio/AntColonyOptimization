# AntColonyOptimization
A simple ACO implementation for TSP. MATLAB code.

This code was developed by Daniel Riofrio. It is based on the paper:  Marco Dorigo et al. - Ant Colony Optimization.

This code is still work in progress. It has the main data structures and the basic idea of how to model a TSP problem, 
as well as an schedule problem (using the bipartite graph representation).
